# CREATING A DATA-DRIVEN WINE MARKETPLACE STRATEGY

In this project, I've analyzed a dataset with 130k different kinds of wines.

All the wines have been reviewed by famous sommeliers who gave a rating for each wine.

In this project, I've supposed a data-driven strategy for a wine marketplace.
The idea was to create a marketplace with the bottles' prices in a certain range but choosing the ones which were given a certain amount of points by the sommeliers.

So, I was able to calculate the initial investment, in terms of the total price for all the bottles.
