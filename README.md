# CREATING A DATA-DRIVEN WINE MARKETPLACE STRATEGY

In this project, I've analyzed a dataset with 130k different kinds of wines.

All the wines have been reviewed by famous sommeliers who gave a rating for each wine.

In this project, I've supposed a data-driven strategy for a wine marketplace.
The idea was to create a marketplace with the bottles' prices in a certain range but choosing the ones which were given a certain amount of points by the sommeliers.

So, I was able to calculate the initial investment, in terms of the total price for all the bottles.

If you are not "a technician" or if you just want to understand the main concepts without reading the code, you can take a look at the PDF I created.
